# mVMC (unofficial spin Jastrow implementation)

* Current [mVMC](https://github.com/issp-center-dev/mVMC) code (at least ver.1.1.1) cannot treat the spin Jastrow factor.
* This is an unofficial patch for the spin Jastrow implementation.
* The simplest modification is to replace the charge Jastrow part in [mVMC/src/mVMC/projection.c](https://github.com/issp-center-dev/mVMC/blob/master/src/mVMC/projection.c) with the spin Jastrow one.
